Once burrowed, Spiked Carapace instantly stuns nearby enemies when cast, the range of Mana Burn and Impale is increased, and Impale's cooldown is decreased. While burrowed, Nyx Assassin is stationary, unable to attack, and invisible. His health and mana regeneration are also increased, and he gains damage reduction from all damage sources.","upgrade_description":null,"image":"https://hgv-hyperstone.azurewebsites.net/abilities/nyx_assassin_burrow.png","hero_id":88,"ability_type":"DOTA_ABILITY_TYPE_BASIC","ability_behaviors":["DOTA_ABILITY_BEHAVIOR_NO_TARGET","DOTA_ABILITY_BEHAVIOR_HIDDEN","DOTA_ABILITY_BEHAVIOR_SHOW_IN_GUIDES"],"ability_unit_target_team":null,"ability_unit_target_type":[],"ability_unit_target_flags":[],"spell_immunity_type":null,"spell_dispellable_type":"SPELL_DISPELLABLE_NO","ability_unit_damage_type":null,"is_skill":false,"is_ultimate":false,"has_scepter_upgrade":true,"on_castbar":true,"on_learnbar":true,"ability_cast_range":[],"ability_cast_range_buffer":250,"ability_cast_point":[1.5],"ability_channel_time":[],"ability_cooldown":[],"ability_duration":[],"ability_damage":[],"ability_mana_cost":[],"ability_modifier_support_value":1.0,"ability_modifier_support_bonus":0.0,"fight_recap_level":1,"ability_draft_enabled":true,"linked":"nyx_assassin_unburrow","ability_special":{"health_regen_rate":[1.5],"mana_regen_rate":[1.5],"damage_reduction":[40.0],"impale_burn_range_increase_pct_tooltip":[75.0],"mana_burn_burrow_range_tooltip":[1050.0],"impale_burrow_range_tooltip":[1225.0],"impale_burrow_cooldown_tooltip":[7.0],"carapace_burrow_range_tooltip":[300.0]},"keywords":null},"heroes":[],"hero_roles":[],"hero_types":[],"combo_abilities":[],"combo_ultimates":[]}
