  "description": "Forms a barrier of energized cogs around Clockwerk, trapping any units that are near.  Enemies outside the trap that touch a cog are knocked back, losing health and mana. Once a cog has delivered a shock, it will power down.  Cogs can be destroyed by enemy attacks, but Clockwerk can destroy them with just one.",
