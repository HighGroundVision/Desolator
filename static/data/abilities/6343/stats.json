  "desc": "Pangolier curls into a magic-immune ball and rolls out. When rolling, he moves at an increased speed and can move through trees, but has a decreased ability to turn. Striking enemies knocks them back, inflicting damage and stunning them when they land.  Colliding with walls or cliffs will cause a temporary pause while Pangolier reverses in direction.
