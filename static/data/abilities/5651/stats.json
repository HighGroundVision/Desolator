  "desc": "Winter Wyvern soars upon an arctic wind, granting her unobstructed movement and allowing her to exhale a blistering chill into each attack. While soaring, her attacks travel further and faster, and slow enemies with a magical freeze that strips them of 6/7/8/9% of their current health each second. Her sight is also hardened against night's chill, granting her 400 additional vision range at night while soaring. Upgradable by Aghanim's Scepter.",
