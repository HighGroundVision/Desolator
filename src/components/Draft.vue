        <p>
          We have currently disabled drafting based on feedback from our users.
          It takes too long currently to enter all the details needed to complete the process.
          To the point most people could not enter the all the details needed before the draft starts.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are still exploring other options and may bring this back in the future.
