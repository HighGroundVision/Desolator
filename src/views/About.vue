    <h4>HGV</h4>
    <p>
      <a href="http://highgroundvision.com">HGV</a> started as a side project of a group of Dota2 fans and it still operates that way. 
      We have a number of other niche tools for Dota2. 
      We don’t intend to make any money from it, although we try to at least break even on the server bills. 
      We’re also happy to share our knowledge with the community by <a href="https://github.com/HighGroundVision/" target="_blank">open sourcing</a> our stack. 
       Development is done by volunteers contributing in their free time.
