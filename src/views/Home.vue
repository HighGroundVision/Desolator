              See how you rank against others in your region. 
              We have created a Elo based rating system that is updated for each <span title="Those that have 'Expose Public Match Data' settings checked">public player</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              As this feature is new it will take some time before the rankings are correctly disturbed as there was no way to seed the players. So all players start at the default calibration.
